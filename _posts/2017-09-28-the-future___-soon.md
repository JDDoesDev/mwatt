## In the year 2000...

What tech has come to us from fiction?  What fiction can we look back at now and laugh at?  Spoiler:  Johnny Mnemonic's storage.

In this episode we examine the tech that we've seen make its way out of fiction and into our lives and the tech we'd like to see.  Join us as we discuss all the science fiction and fantasy tech from our favorite movies, shows, and books that we want to be available.

We also come up with a few ideas of our own, but you'll have to listen to find out!
